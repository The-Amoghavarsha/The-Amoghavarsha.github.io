      <description>Do you remember the meme, which goes, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m connecting to my WiFi using terminal, my friends&amp;hellip;HACKER&amp;rdquo;? I have never seen anyone doing that in real life. But nowadays I have a strong reason to do that in the presence or absence of my friends.&#xA;For some strange reason, my desktop environments keep breaking the much needed nm-applet. For those who may not know, generally speaking, nm-applet is the WiFi icon that you see on the top or bottom right of your screen; when clicked shows the WiFi networks available nearby.</description>

      <description>I recently started seeing a lot of posts related to illegal web scarping by AI companies, all thanks to frequency illusion. In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the basics of web scraping and let&amp;rsquo;s learn how to scrape things from the web. Legality Before jumping straight into the weeds, let&amp;rsquo;s address the elephant in the room: &amp;ldquo;Is it legal to scrape the web?&amp;rdquo;. Well, it depends on who we ask this question.</description>

      <description>Plot A few days ago, I was trying to set up an angular project. The goal was simple, that was to install angular-cli with npm or yarn. Easy-peasy.&#xA;But, the bad omen struck. Angular is a careful, robust, feature-rich framework. When I say careful, it&amp;rsquo;s very specific in many ways. The command was simple: npm install -g @angular/cli. Wanted to install angular globally, super simple, nothing crazy. Typically, it was supposed to be installed, but didn&amp;rsquo;t!</description>

      <description>Have you ever encountered the above error? It&amp;rsquo;s pretty annoying, innit?&#xA;Generally, it&amp;rsquo;s either called initramfs or busybox error. It typically indicates an issue during the boot process of a Linux system.&#xA;Initramfs (initial RAM file system) is a temporary file system that is loaded into memory during the boot process before the root file system is mounted. BusyBox is a set of utilities designed for embedded systems, and it is often used in initramfs environment.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I was working on a side project and wanted to hide a few files from Git. In the process, .gitignore caught my eye, and I started digging deeper into it. .gitignore ignores files or directories but doesn’t hide them, but how? Let’s investigate!&#xA;A .gitignore file is used to specify files or directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes in our project.&#xA;The purpose of .</description>

It uses ssh to transfer files, safely and securely.&#xA;In order to transfer files from one computer to another, type the following command:&#xA;scp /location/of/the/file username@ip_address_of_remote_computer:/location For example: scp ~/apple.png amogh@192.168.0.122:/amogh/home/Downloads If you want to send an entire folder, you can do that by using -r flag:&#xA;scp /location/of/the/folder username@ip_address_of_remote_computer:/location For example: scp -r ~/Downloads/MyDownloads amogh@192.168.0.122:/amogh/home/ If you have multiple ssh keys, you have to specify a particular one using -i flag:</description>

      <description>Securely connecting two computers using SSH is fairly simple and powerful. But if you are new to the world of computers, especially GNU/Linux, it could be a bit tricky to get around some basic stuff. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you the step-by-step process to communicate between two computers using SSH.&#xA;Basics The idea is pretty simple. There are two Linux computers; let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. To access computer A from B (connecting to A using B&amp;rsquo;s machine), we need to place B&amp;rsquo;s public key inside A.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Community: a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a fission reaction! If we consider the whole world as a giant community and start dividing it into subgroups, there would be millions of little groups. Some call it diversity, and some call it poles. Whatever it is, we live in some kind of community, knowingly or unknowingly.&#xA;Some communities we choose deliberately because they pique our interest, and some of them are just inevitable.</description>

      <description>“$” might symbolize dollars to many of you, but for bash users it’s the holy grail for retrieving stored data. Speaking of which, do you know what’s the common place to store a piece of data? A variable.&#xA;Variable The name itself incurs that variable is something that could be varied. So is it like a chameleon that changes colors all the time? Not precisely, if you remember from the intro its a common place to store a piece of data.</description>

Just kidding, I don’t want to fuzz around any further, or maybe I do? So let’s jump in to the world of Radamsa.&#xA;Radamsa is a fuzzer. In technical terms, it is a test case generator for robustness testing. Typically, it is used to test how well a program could tolerate potentially malicious input. It works by reading files of valid data and generating random outputs every time from them.</description>

      <description>Hiding in plain sight has many dimensions. Sometimes, whatever you are looking for is before you, but you cannot see it; other times, it’s right before you but you don’t notice.&#xA;Steganography has been an art since the ancient days used to write hidden messages. It has evolved over the ages, and has changed form for the better. Nowadays we have software to hide and obfuscate messages. In this article, we’ll take a look at some amazing steganographic tools which are tiny yet powerful.</description>
