      <description>Securely connecting two computers using SSH is fairly simple and powerful. But if you are new to the world of computers, especially GNU/Linux, it could be a bit tricky to get around some basic stuff. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you the step-by-step process to communicate between two computers using SSH.
Basics The idea is pretty simple. There are two Linux computers; let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. To access computer A from B (connecting to A using B&amp;rsquo;s machine), we need to place B&amp;rsquo;s public key inside A.</description>

      <title>Communities - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Community: a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a fission reaction! If we consider the whole world as a giant community and start dividing it into subgroups, there would be millions of little groups. Some call it diversity, and some call it poles. Whatever it is, we live in some kind of community, knowingly or unknowingly.
Some communities we choose deliberately because they pique our interest, and some of them are just inevitable.</description>

      <description>I recently joined Facebook. It&amp;rsquo;s been some odd 6-7 years ago since I left the platform. The reason for rejoining Facebook is fairly simple - Communities. Well, the social media platform has been around for many years, and their penetration is massive. There are so many old tech, travel, food, entrepreneurship communities thriving on Facebook. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of doom scrolling, lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in programming communities and I am trying to answer the majority of questions there.</description>

      <title>Arrays Are Powerful In Bash</title>

      <description>“$” might symbolize dollars to many of you, but for bash users it’s the holy grail for retrieving stored data. Speaking of which, do you know what’s the common place to store a piece of data? A variable.
Variable The name itself incurs that variable is something that could be varied. So is it like a chameleon that changes colors all the time? Not precisely, if you remember from the intro its a common place to store a piece of data.</description>

&amp;ldquo;oS$INTFOR@LL&amp;rdquo;
Did you know that Osint For All has many secret domain names? Just kidding, I don’t want to fuzz around any further, or maybe I do? So let’s jump in to the world of Radamsa.
Radamsa is a fuzzer. In technical terms, it is a test case generator for robustness testing. Typically, it is used to test how well a program could tolerate potentially malicious input. It works by reading files of valid data and generating random outputs every time from them.</description>

      <description>I am a big movie buff. Since the day I started using the computer, before diving into the internals of the computer, I’ve spent a lot of time watching movies. Maybe that’s a fractal stain in almost all Indian Engineering colleges. Even now, I love to watch movies/TV shows like the rest.
Phase 1 I don’t exactly remember what was the first foreign film that I watched. Back then, I used to have a friend who gave me a lot of English movies, such as Inception (which I watched after five years), Fight Club (which I watched lethargically), Prestige (which I watched but didn’t remember).</description>

      <description>Hiding in plain sight has many dimensions. Sometimes, whatever you are looking for is before you, but you cannot see it; other times, it’s right before you but you don’t notice.
Steganography has been an art since the ancient days used to write hidden messages. It has evolved over the ages, and has changed form for the better. Nowadays we have software to hide and obfuscate messages. In this article, we’ll take a look at some amazing steganographic tools which are tiny yet powerful.</description>
