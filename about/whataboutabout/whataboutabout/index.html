        <p>What about about? I really don&rsquo;t know. Well, I&rsquo;m the founder of <a href="https://osintforall.in/">Osint For All</a>, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.</p>
<p>But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my <strong>ABOUT</strong> page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about <strong>MYSELF</strong> (subjective based on viewer&rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.</p>
<p>Maybe for you, your <strong>JOB</strong> defines you or whatever the supreme work you do defines you, but for me, <em>I can just try to define myself by the end of my life</em>. If I wanted  my job to define me, I had LinkedIn as a go to website, why would have I bothered to create this <strong>PERSONAL</strong> website? On the one hand, there&rsquo;s a privacy issue, on the other hand I do N number of things (apart from job) and I have many things to do in the future, so it would be an injustice if I just conform myself to a job or a particular work.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t have a <strong>SPECIFIC</strong> goal in life or my life is unstable; of course I have a lot of goals in life,  but haven&rsquo;t you seen that motivational quote from social media, &ldquo;Doing is better than saying&rdquo;, &ldquo;Work hard in silence, let the success make noise&rdquo;; that&rsquo;s noice.</p>
<p>I think many of you might relate with this modern day phenomenon. Today, we have to be a 10x coder, marketer, activist, woke, hacker, husband/wife/partner, father/mother (or choose not to have a child), liberal, rich, talented, visionary, innovator, conservative, for or against Elon Musk etc., I have seen many people writing all those things on Twitter, recently I also updated few things and only I know what I mean by all those things. I wish I would have been born in the 16th century or something, so that I would have had more headspace and more time to invent and write! Or I would have also ended up as a slave, king, potter, artist, poet, singer somewhere.</p>
<p>All this mess is because of the system that we have built, you can divide yourself politically, debating about if it&rsquo;s good or bad or ugly. But the truth in the material world is, you have to be like that. Is this a new thing? Wasn&rsquo;t there any competition or mental health issues in the 16th century? Of course, we had all the problems, <em>there could have been no present without history</em> and that&rsquo;s the reality.</p>
<p>Finding oneself is a life long process, we as an intelligent species (as per as our research), will possibly create a lot of problems and will also strive to find solutions those problems and on the positive side, we&rsquo;ll also create some good things in the future. And probably I will also witness all those things for some time.</p>
