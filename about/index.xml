      <description>What about about? I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m the founder of Osint For All, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&amp;rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.
But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my ABOUT page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about MYSELF (subjective based on viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;What about about? I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://osintforall.in/&#34;&gt;Osint For All&lt;/a&gt;, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&amp;rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my &lt;strong&gt;ABOUT&lt;/strong&gt; page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about &lt;strong&gt;MYSELF&lt;/strong&gt; (subjective based on viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe for you, your &lt;strong&gt;JOB&lt;/strong&gt; defines you or whatever the supreme work you do defines you, but for me, &lt;em&gt;I can just try to define myself by the end of my life&lt;/em&gt;. If I wanted  my job to define me, I had LinkedIn as a go to website, why would have I bothered to create this &lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL&lt;/strong&gt; website? On the one hand, there&amp;rsquo;s a privacy issue, on the other hand I do N number of things (apart from job) and I have many things to do in the future, so it would be an injustice if I just conform myself to a job or a particular work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;strong&gt;SPECIFIC&lt;/strong&gt; goal in life or my life is unstable; of course I have a lot of goals in life,  but haven&amp;rsquo;t you seen that motivational quote from social media, &amp;ldquo;Doing is better than saying&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Work hard in silence, let the success make noise&amp;rdquo;; that&amp;rsquo;s noice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think many of you might relate with this modern day phenomenon. Today, we have to be a 10x coder, marketer, activist, woke, hacker, husband/wife/partner, father/mother (or choose not to have a child), liberal, rich, talented, visionary, innovator, conservative, for or against Elon Musk etc., I have seen many people writing all those things on Twitter, recently I also updated few things and only I know what I mean by all those things. I wish I would have been born in the 16th century or something, so that I would have had more headspace and more time to invent and write! Or I would have also ended up as a slave, king, potter, artist, poet, singer somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this mess is because of the system that we have built, you can divide yourself politically, debating about if it&amp;rsquo;s good or bad or ugly. But the truth in the material world is, you have to be like that. Is this a new thing? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t there any competition or mental health issues in the 16th century? Of course, we had all the problems, &lt;em&gt;there could have been no present without history&lt;/em&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding oneself is a life long process, we as an intelligent species (as per as our research), will possibly create a lot of problems and will also strive to find solutions to those problems and on the positive side, we&amp;rsquo;ll also create some good things in the future. And probably I will also witness all those things for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memories of childhood..things that were lost</title>

      <description>Where should I begin? Did I have the best childhood in the world? I don’t think so, but the fact that I didn’t know anything about childhood or adulthood was a solace.
“Knowing Nothing” could be a taboo in this generation. But knowing nothing and knowing that I don’t know anything is something that made me a care free child, and I loved it. But it didn’t last for a very long time, as I realized that I wanted to pass examinations to qualify for the next classes!</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Knowing Nothing” could be a taboo in this generation. But knowing nothing and knowing that I don’t know anything is something that made me a care free child, and I loved it. But it didn’t last for a very long time, as I realized that I wanted to pass examinations to qualify for the next classes! Life is all about experiences, one cannot possibly control their experiences, especially when they are younger. Good, bad or ugly, you’ll only know when you grow up. Personally, for me, it was the combination of everything, and that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start from the warmth of the sun, the one that helps with the mornings, photosynthesis, and beautiful ‘sunsets’ sometimes. Getting back home after school, washing my body with cold water, and feeling a little chill and warming my legs on the balcony was fun. I barely remember someone telling me that exposing oneself to the sun is a good thing and that was my way of getting vitamin D. And I feel that it wasn’t that sunny at that time, even if the afternoons were a good time to play with friends. We barely got tired, never cared about the sweat, neither did my friends, we looked all fresh after we used to sprinkle water on our faces, and felt elated with what we all did in the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was in class two, I looked in a mirror, touched my face and had an existential question—“Who am I?” I had it a few times after that, especially in the morning when I went out to brush my teeth. Furthermore, I couldn’t find the answer and I moved on. Sometimes, I think even if I had tried a little more, my life would have been different now, I presume. Nothing’s absolute when everything is a variable in chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And fast-forward to the next three years, when I saw the wind, and the cloudy evenings. I used to feel thrilled about summer evenings, especially the beginnings of the monsoon rains. I used to sleep on the terrace and enjoy the wind and the raindrops. Surprisingly, I don’t remember much about rain at that time. Maybe it was destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the rain a few years after that. I used to stand alone and get soaked in the rain, and run around and enjoy nature’s showers. Not only that, but I never caught a cold at that point in time. I don’t know why. Perhaps that’s how nature loved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, looking back on all these things, I feel that the sky is the only constant that I can relate to. I cannot find the same climate anywhere. I don’t know what spring, summer, rainy and winter seasons are anymore. It’s nice to hear the phrase “Change is the only constant in life”, but it comes with a cost, where you neither know what happened nor why it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New found love</title>

      <description>Recently, I started playing computer games. Well, I know they are not new to many people here, but, me being a gamer? A cold day in hell. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can call myself a &amp;ldquo;gamer&amp;rdquo; now. Because my interests are in minimal games that range between 1-100 MB.
Prelude It was inevitable that I should have to switch to some starter GNU/Linux distributions. As there was a situation where I could not have suddenly switched to the Masterrace distros, I started to look into the distro&amp;rsquo;s software manager and then I found the category called &amp;ldquo;Games&amp;rdquo;.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started playing computer games. Well, I know they are not new to many people here, but, me being a gamer? A cold day in hell. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can call myself a &amp;ldquo;gamer&amp;rdquo; now. Because my interests are in minimal games that range between 1-100 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable that I should have to switch to some starter GNU/Linux distributions. As there was a situation where I could not have suddenly switched to the Masterrace distros, I started to look into the distro&amp;rsquo;s software manager and then I found the category called &amp;ldquo;Games&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends are great gamers, but not me. The reason being I was never raised in the cradle of computers or technology. Another reason is, I just find it wasteful when a lot of GPUs&#39; energy gets sucked in by high end games. But, here we are today. The open source community makes games where I can read the source code and they are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not my first time that I have gotten to the nine day wonder of gaming. I used to play some FPS games on my Linux machine, then I used to do the &amp;lsquo;silent quitting&amp;rsquo; without regrets. But this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different. I found this game called &lt;em&gt;Assult Cube&lt;/em&gt;, which is around 50 MB and it gives a decent full-fledged FPS experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;offshoot&#34;&gt;Offshoot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found many other games (or maybe I exhausted all of them during the research) which are minimal and keep me entertaining during the break. The irony is, a break is metaphorical. Some are really addictive. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mention every single one of them here, when you can find some really good ones that are your type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming is addictive. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m going into a loop which I don&amp;rsquo;t realise when I&amp;rsquo;m in. It&amp;rsquo;s a focus inside distraction. Hypnotism has never been so real. Hope self-discretion doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn into indignation, as I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose my new found love!&lt;/p&gt;
