      <description>What about about? I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m the founder of Osint For All, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&amp;rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.
But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my ABOUT page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about MYSELF (subjective based on viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;What about about? I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://osintforall.in/&#34;&gt;Osint For All&lt;/a&gt;, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&amp;rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my &lt;strong&gt;ABOUT&lt;/strong&gt; page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about &lt;strong&gt;MYSELF&lt;/strong&gt; (subjective based on viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe for you, your &lt;strong&gt;JOB&lt;/strong&gt; defines you or whatever the supreme work you do defines you, but for me, &lt;em&gt;I can just try to define myself by the end of my life&lt;/em&gt;. If I wanted  my job to define me, I had LinkedIn as a go to website, why would have I bothered to create this &lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL&lt;/strong&gt; website? On the one hand, there&amp;rsquo;s a privacy issue, on the other hand I do N number of things (apart from job) and I have many things to do in the future, so it would be an injustice if I just conform myself to a job or a particular work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;strong&gt;SPECIFIC&lt;/strong&gt; goal in life or my life is unstable; of course I have a lot of goals in life,  but haven&amp;rsquo;t you seen that motivational quote from social media, &amp;ldquo;Doing is better than saying&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Work hard in silence, let the success make noise&amp;rdquo;; that&amp;rsquo;s noice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think many of you might relate with this modern day phenomenon. Today, we have to be a 10x coder, marketer, activist, woke, hacker, husband/wife/partner, father/mother (or choose not to have a child), liberal, rich, talented, visionary, innovator, conservative, for or against Elon Musk etc., I have seen many people writing all those things on Twitter, recently I also updated few things and only I know what I mean by all those things. I wish I would have been born in the 16th century or something, so that I would have had more headspace and more time to invent and write! Or I would have also ended up as a slave, king, potter, artist, poet, singer somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this mess is because of the system that we have built, you can divide yourself politically, debating about if it&amp;rsquo;s good or bad or ugly. But the truth in the material world is, you have to be like that. Is this a new thing? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t there any competition or mental health issues in the 16th century? Of course, we had all the problems, &lt;em&gt;there could have been no present without history&lt;/em&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding oneself is a life long process, we as an intelligent species (as per as our research), will possibly create a lot of problems and will also strive to find solutions those problems and on the positive side, we&amp;rsquo;ll also create some good things in the future. And probably I will also witness all those things for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
