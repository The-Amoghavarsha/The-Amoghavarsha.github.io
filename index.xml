      <description>GitHub Pages or gh-pages is one of the easiest ways to deploy static sites. But, did you know that you can also easily deploy a simple React app on GitHub Pages? Without any further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&#xA;First, install gh-pages on the React app by typing:&#xA;npm install gh-pages --save-dev Next, edit package.json by adding:&#xA;&amp;#34;homepage&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;https://yourdomain.github.io/your-react-app&amp;#34; at the top, just after { and add a couple of lines inside &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot; object:</description>

      <description>Mastodon is a Twitter-like micro-blogging platform. There are a lot of tweaks that you can make on Masto, as it&amp;rsquo;s free and open-source software. It provides you with a way to verify your websites on the platform in an indie web-style way.&#xA;What Does It Mean? Imagine you have a personal blog or a website, obviously hosted on the web. So it is your online identity.&#xA;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say, you also have other social media, and generally you would like to provide a link to your personal website or blog in the bio/description.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I was working on a side project and wanted to hide a few files from Git. In the process, .gitignore caught my eye, and I started digging deeper into it. .gitignore ignores files or directories but doesn’t hide them, but how? Let’s investigate!&#xA;A .gitignore file is used to specify files or directories that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes in our project.&#xA;The purpose of .</description>

      <description>scp is a secure way of transferring files from one computer to another. It uses ssh to transfer files, safely and securely.&#xA;In order to transfer files from one computer to another, type the following command:&#xA;scp /location/of/the/file username@ip_address_of_remote_computer:/location For example: scp ~/apple.png amogh@192.168.0.122:/amogh/home/Downloads If you want to send an entire folder, you can do that by using -r flag:&#xA;scp /location/of/the/folder username@ip_address_of_remote_computer:/location For example: scp -r ~/Downloads/MyDownloads amogh@192.168.0.122:/amogh/home/ If you have multiple ssh keys, you have to specify a particular one using -i flag:</description>

      <description>In the previous article you learnt how to connect between two Linux machines, in this tutorial, you are going to learn how to manage more than one ssh keypair effectively.&#xA;In your .ssh directory, create a file called config. Inside the config add the following lines:&#xA;Host Cat HostName cat.com User amoghavarsha IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa IdentitiesOnly yes Host Dog HostName dog.com User amoghavarsha IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.1 IdentitiesOnly yes Host * AddKeysToAgent yes IdentityFile ~/.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how you can do pair programming with your friends using some simple tools?&#xA;To achieve this, you only need two things: ssh and tmux.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve already explained about ssh in my other articles, you can go and check them out to get some basic understanding.&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed tmux, you can do so by typing the following command (Works for Debian based systems):&#xA;sudo apt install tmux On the remote server, start a new tmux session.</description>

      <description>Securely connecting two computers using SSH is fairly simple and powerful. But if you are new to the world of computers, especially GNU/Linux, it could be a bit tricky to get around some basic stuff. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you the step-by-step process to communicate between two computers using SSH.&#xA;Basics The idea is pretty simple. There are two Linux computers; let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. To access computer A from B (connecting to A using B&amp;rsquo;s machine), we need to place B&amp;rsquo;s public key inside A.</description>

      <title>Communities - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Community: a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a fission reaction! If we consider the whole world as a giant community and start dividing it into subgroups, there would be millions of little groups. Some call it diversity, and some call it poles. Whatever it is, we live in some kind of community, knowingly or unknowingly.&#xA;Some communities we choose deliberately because they pique our interest, and some of them are just inevitable.</description>

      <description>I recently joined Facebook. It&amp;rsquo;s been some odd 6-7 years ago since I left the platform. The reason for rejoining Facebook is fairly simple - Communities. Well, the social media platform has been around for many years, and their penetration is massive. There are so many old tech, travel, food, entrepreneurship communities thriving on Facebook. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of doom scrolling, lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in programming communities and I am trying to answer the majority of questions there.</description>

      <description>“$” might symbolize dollars to many of you, but for bash users it’s the holy grail for retrieving stored data. Speaking of which, do you know what’s the common place to store a piece of data? A variable.&#xA;Variable The name itself incurs that variable is something that could be varied. So is it like a chameleon that changes colors all the time? Not precisely, if you remember from the intro its a common place to store a piece of data.</description>

Just kidding, I don’t want to fuzz around any further, or maybe I do? So let’s jump in to the world of Radamsa.&#xA;Radamsa is a fuzzer. In technical terms, it is a test case generator for robustness testing. Typically, it is used to test how well a program could tolerate potentially malicious input. It works by reading files of valid data and generating random outputs every time from them.</description>

      <description>I am a big movie buff. Since the day I started using the computer, before diving into the internals of the computer, I’ve spent a lot of time watching movies. Maybe that’s a fractal stain in almost all Indian Engineering colleges. Even now, I love to watch movies/TV shows like the rest.&#xA;Phase 1 I don’t exactly remember what was the first foreign film that I watched. Back then, I used to have a friend who gave me a lot of English movies, such as Inception (which I watched after five years), Fight Club (which I watched lethargically), Prestige (which I watched but didn’t remember).</description>

      <description>Hiding in plain sight has many dimensions. Sometimes, whatever you are looking for is before you, but you cannot see it; other times, it’s right before you but you don’t notice.&#xA;Steganography has been an art since the ancient days used to write hidden messages. It has evolved over the ages, and has changed form for the better. Nowadays we have software to hide and obfuscate messages. In this article, we’ll take a look at some amazing steganographic tools which are tiny yet powerful.</description>
