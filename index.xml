      <description>‚Äú$‚Äù might symbolize dollars to many of you, but for bash users it‚Äôs the holy grail for retrieving stored data. Speaking of which, do you know what‚Äôs the common place to store a piece of data? A variable.
Variable The name itself incurs that variable is something that could be varied. So is it like a chameleon that changes colors all the time? Not precisely, if you remember from the intro its a common place to store a piece of data.</description>

      <description>I am a big movie buff. Since the day I started using the computer, before diving into the internals of the computer, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time watching movies. Maybe that‚Äôs a fractal stain in almost all Indian Engineering colleges. Even now, I love to watch movies/TV shows like the rest.
Phase 1 I don‚Äôt exactly remember what was the first foreign film that I watched. Back then, I used to have a friend who gave me a lot of English movies, such as Inception (which I watched after five years), Fight Club (which I watched lethargically), Prestige (which I watched but didn‚Äôt remember).</description>
