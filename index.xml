      <description>What about about? I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m the founder of Osint For All, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&amp;rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.
But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my ABOUT page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about MYSELF (subjective based on viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;What about about? I really don&amp;rsquo;t know. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;https://osintforall.in/&#34;&gt;Osint For All&lt;/a&gt;, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I&amp;rsquo;m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my &lt;strong&gt;ABOUT&lt;/strong&gt; page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about &lt;strong&gt;MYSELF&lt;/strong&gt; (subjective based on viewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective) sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe for you, your &lt;strong&gt;JOB&lt;/strong&gt; defines you or whatever the supreme work you do defines you, but for me, &lt;em&gt;I can just try to define myself by the end of my life&lt;/em&gt;. If I wanted  my job to define me, I had LinkedIn as a go to website, why would have I bothered to create this &lt;strong&gt;PERSONAL&lt;/strong&gt; website? On the one hand, there&amp;rsquo;s a privacy issue, on the other hand I do N number of things (apart from job) and I have many things to do in the future, so it would be an injustice if I just conform myself to a job or a particular work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;strong&gt;SPECIFIC&lt;/strong&gt; goal in life or my life is unstable; of course I have a lot of goals in life,  but haven&amp;rsquo;t you seen that motivational quote from social media, &amp;ldquo;Doing is better than saying&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Work hard in silence, let the success make noise&amp;rdquo;; that&amp;rsquo;s noice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think many of you might relate with this modern day phenomenon. Today, we have to be a 10x coder, marketer, activist, woke, hacker, husband/wife/partner, father/mother (or choose not to have a child), liberal, rich, talented, visionary, innovator, conservative, for or against Elon Musk etc., I have seen many people writing all those things on Twitter, recently I also updated few things and only I know what I mean by all those things. I wish I would have been born in the 16th century or something, so that I would have had more headspace and more time to invent and write! Or I would have also ended up as a slave, king, potter, artist, poet, singer somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this mess is because of the system that we have built, you can divide yourself politically, debating about if it&amp;rsquo;s good or bad or ugly. But the truth in the material world is, you have to be like that. Is this a new thing? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t there any competition or mental health issues in the 16th century? Of course, we had all the problems, &lt;em&gt;there could have been no present without history&lt;/em&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;s the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding oneself is a life long process, we as an intelligent species (as per as our research), will possibly create a lot of problems and will also strive to find solutions to those problems and on the positive side, we&amp;rsquo;ll also create some good things in the future. And probably I will also witness all those things for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;eye&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“$” might symbolize dollars to many of you, but for bash users it’s
the holy grail for retrieving stored data. Speaking of which, do you
know what’s the common place to store a piece of data? A variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;variable&#34;&gt;Variable&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name itself incurs that variable is something that could be
varied. So is it like a chameleon that changes colors all the time?
Not precisely, if you remember from the intro its a common place to
store a piece of data. That’s right. Mathematically and
computationally, a variable is something that stores or holds a
piece of data or value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard the term “place holder” and that’s exactly what
a variable is. So how to store and retrieve information through
variables?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;place=&amp;quot;World&amp;quot;
echo &amp;quot;Hello $place&amp;quot; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code snippet, place is a variable and World is the
value assigned to the variable. In the next line, the value assigned to the variable is retrieved through echo command. As
aforementioned, “$” is the holy grail to retrieve stored value in
bash. An important thing to note here is, “=” doesn’t mean variable
name has a constant value, it just means that a value is assigned to
a variable name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the value of variable place could be varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;place=&amp;quot;Mars&amp;quot;
echo &amp;quot;Hello $place&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/3.png&#34; alt=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the value of variable has changed to Mars from World. Imagine a
box where you could place an item and replace that item whenever you
wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/5.png&#34; alt=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to store many pieces of data in a single box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;array&#34;&gt;Array&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Array is an ordered series of arrangement. Computationally, array
holds multiple values, whereas a normal variable holds a single
value. Array could also be defined as a special type of variable as
it could hold more than one value.
A typical array consists of an array name and an index. Each index
number associates with an element in the array.
Lets see how to create an array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies=(&#39;Primer&#39; &#39;Inception&#39; &#39;Enemy&#39; &#39;Tenet&#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things to keep in mind. Unlike other programming languages, bash
arrays are not led by commas after every element but spaces. There
is no space after array name(i.e, movies=), it’s followed by “=”. If
there is a space followed by the array name, shell interprets the
array name as a program to execute and “=” as the first parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets try to retrieve all the elements of the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/6.png&#34; alt=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you could see in the above screenshot, you could retrieve the
array elements in two ways: one using the @ symbol between the
square brackets or using * symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips, you could remember @ by memorizing it like all
and * is a wild card which signifies everything. The syntax of
retrieving an array could look intimidating, so always remember “$”
is the holy grail for retrieving information, array names are placed
in between flower brackets {}, followed by special characters or
numbers in square brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets see how to retrieve an individual element of the array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/7.png&#34; alt=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Index numbers in bash arrays starts with 0 (similar to most of the
programming language, unlike R). So index 2 returns the value of
Enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what happens when negative indices are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/8.png&#34; alt=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the negative index number retrieves values from reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also assign elements to the array explicitly in three
ways: Subscript Assignment, Index Assignment and assignment by name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscript Assignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies=([4]=&#39;Ten cloverfield lane&#39; [5]=&#39;Timecrimes&#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/9.png&#34; alt=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Index Assignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies[1]=&#39;Vanilla Sky&#39;
movies[2]=&#39;Mr.Nobody&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/10.png&#34; alt=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assignment by names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;movies[zero]=&#39;Magnolia&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/11.png&#34; alt=&#34;11&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to print the elements from one particular index to
another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/12.png&#34; alt=&#34;12&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you are telling the array that from all its elements(@) , print
from index 1 to index 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/13.png&#34; alt=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you are telling the array that from all its elements(@), start
from index 1 and print all the following elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if, you want to access the index numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;${!movies[@]}&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/14.png&#34; alt=&#34;14&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “!” symbol before array name helps to retrieve indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to see how many elements are there in an array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;${#movies[@]}&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/15.png&#34; alt=&#34;15&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “#” symbol before array name helps to retrieve number of
elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to retrieve specific information from an element in the array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/16.png&#34; alt=&#34;16&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the information of zeroth element(Magnolia) is retrieved,
starting from index 0 till index 2(not included).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to assign a sequence of numbers? You could do it
manually but here’s a easy way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/17.png&#34; alt=&#34;17&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;seq&lt;/em&gt; is a shell command that prints out sequence of numbers. In the
above example, &lt;em&gt;seq&lt;/em&gt; is placed in between ` `.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets try to write a simple shell script from the above
learnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/llp/AIB/usr/llp/AIB/bin/llp/AIB/bash
tvshows=(&#39;Mr.Robot&#39; &#39;Homeland&#39; &#39;The Americans&#39; &#39;Death Note&#39; &#39;Erased&#39;)
for a in &amp;quot;${!tvshows[@]}&amp;quot;; do
printf &amp;quot;${tvshows[$a]} has an index number of $a\n&amp;quot;
done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s save the code as lp.sh. Next lets make it executable – chmod
+x lp.sh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/18.png&#34; alt=&#34;18&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the program is executed, you get the above result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;array-modification&#34;&gt;Array Modification&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets create a new array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;names=(&#39;Luther&#39; &#39;Ambrose&#39; &#39;Reddington&#39; &#39;Mare&#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To change the value of index 2 you could do the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;names[2]=’Carrie’
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/19.png&#34; alt=&#34;19&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if, you want to append values by adding more elements to the
array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/20.png&#34; alt=&#34;20&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if, you want to add an element at a particular index position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/21.png&#34; alt=&#34;21&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to delete an element?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/22.png&#34; alt=&#34;22&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, unset is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUoa6yh6v4AhXsSmwGHQMKDlMQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FShell_builtin&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1BOf5zWyabXMcp7cEqn3O5&#34;&gt;shell builtin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/23.png&#34; alt=&#34;23&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to merge two arrays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets create another array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;surnames=(&#39;Dexter&#39; &#39;Hannibal&#39; &#39;Broody&#39; &#39;Dan&#39; &#39;Gordan&#39; &#39;Steve&#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/24.png&#34; alt=&#34;24&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to delete an array?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;unset &amp;lt;array_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/25.png&#34; alt=&#34;25&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;associative-array&#34;&gt;Associative Array&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An associative array is an array that stores string value as an
index. It could be declared and used in a bash script. This feature
was added in bash 4. To be sure, just check your bash version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/26.png&#34; alt=&#34;26&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declaring an associative array is easy, here’s the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;declare -A &amp;lt;array_name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets declare an associative array and initialize some elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/27.png&#34; alt=&#34;27&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like in normal array, if you want to access an element of the array,
use the following syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/28.png&#34; alt=&#34;28&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to list the indices of the associative array, do the
following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/29.png&#34; alt=&#34;29&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets try to write a simple script to print the indices(keys) and
values of the associative array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/30.png&#34; alt=&#34;30&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a catch, what if you want to display the indices in an
alphabetic order?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/31.png&#34; alt=&#34;31&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reverse it, use –reverse flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/llp/AIB/32.png&#34; alt=&#34;32&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s it for today. Do practice arrays; because they are
powerful! Show some love by sharing and subscribing to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLi7utjkBxAYPtVQhTuiZ2Q&#34;&gt;Linux For Love &amp;amp; Passion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email Investigations – Accessibility And Limitations.</title>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Even in the age of instant messaging apps, email still serves as an
‘official’ medium to communicate between two parties. It’s ironic
that electronic mail has not lost its charm till date within the
barrage of privacy respecting encrypted chat messengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, email services nowadays are adapting to the new age norm of
privacy and making their products more privacy hardened with
encrypted mailboxes or hard to locate data centers and so on. But
the core technology behind email hasn’t changed since its inception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-steps&#34;&gt;First Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become a tradition for any experienced or rookie
investigators to start their investigation just by ‘Googling’ stuff
out. Finding information about emails is no different, an email that
has to be investigated could be played around in a variety of forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a plain email is put in the search bar, the results are limited
to the fact that how often that email has been used in public and
how open it is to the public. To simplify, if the email is used on
multiple blogs, academic websites, personal websites, social media,
paste bins, forums etc,. There is a strong chance of retrieving the
information about the keywords in the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/email/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the above image, it’s evident that Google search engine
retrieved the information with some keywords involved within the
email. It recognized some keywords like ‘john’, ‘snow’, and ‘gmail’.
But it didn’t point towards the exact email; why? Because the exact
email wasn’t open for viewing in the wild. Interestingly it also
tried to match the keywords from different social media such as
Twitter and Pininterest. Endless scrolling and jumping to each page
might lead to the exact email or might not, and that’s the
limitation for the investigators and a slight win for privacy
settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding quotes around the email tells the search engine to look for
the exact keywords that’s specified within the quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/email/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, with quotes the email led to one of the primary
sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, using quotes around an email tries to retrieve specific
information if it exists on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it? Is it that easy to retrieve information on anyone just by
Googling the email address? Well, the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/email/3.png&#34; alt=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/email/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As aforementioned, Google or any search engines could retrieve the
information only if they are present on the internet. It depends on
a lot of factors such as one’s privacy settings, social engagement,
relevance, repeated usage of the same email, or being public and so
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dorking&#34;&gt;Dorking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google dorking is an advanced way of searching results on the
internet. Other searching engines such as DuckDuckGo, Bing,
Startpage, Brave Search and so on could also be used for dorking.
Basically, dorking lets the user to concise the search results and
provide the accurate result as possible. And dorking is not only
limited to search engines, prominent social media platforms like
Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Vkontakte etc,. have their own set of
dorks. Yet again, it depends on the information that’s already
available and privacy measures of the user. An article about

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tools on the internet that promise to provide much
more information about an email address than just Googling. A caveat
here is, those tools are also scraping the data from the internet
probably with better scraping methods and algorithms. These tools
also change every now and then, due to the changes made from the
product/service provider’s end (email) or changes made in their own
code(tools). And it’s not new to the OSINT community if some service
goes down or becomes redundant, there’ll always be new tools which
could be more or less efficient and that depends on various factors
that are discussed in the previous paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tools to find information on emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://epieos.com/&#34;&gt;Epieos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hunter.io/email-finder&#34;&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.spiderfoot.net/&#34;&gt;SpiderFoot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.maltego.com/&#34;&gt;Maltego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://anymailfinder.com/&#34;&gt;Anymailfinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://intelx.io/&#34;&gt;IntelligenceX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;miscellaneous-techniques&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous Techniques&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it stalking or curiosity to know, some platforms such as Skype,
lets their users to search usernames or emails of other users. Even
in Gmail, some recommendations appear while one types an email for
the first time. Some apps also provide information about other users
when one’s contacts are synced. There could be many other apps out
there which provide a functionality to search for emails or
usernames. Another trick could be by changing language in inspect
element, or changing geographical location using proxies or VPNs to
fetch country specific results. Last but not the least, using the
power of other search engines and web scrapers along with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email investigation through publicly available information is tricky
and prone to many false positives. This is because of the fact that
email service providers are becoming more closed to protect their
users’ privacy. And also, most of the search engines out there are
not &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;, it means no one knows how their algorithms work or how exactly they query information time to time and how a particular
information is queried. This is a challenge for many SEO experts and
email marketers to update themselves and understand how search
engines function and change overtime. There are dorks, but again
their use cases are limited. But the use of emails seems to not stop
anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is programming an art or a craft?</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the fundamental question, “What is programming? (Coding, Computer programming)”. My answer would be pretty subjective this time – “It’s a way to solve material world problems with efficiency and optimization”
Is programming an art or a craft? Art can be faked, but the craft can’t. Well, this is true indeed. Any piece of art ever created is subjective, to make it more cheesy with modern day WhatsApp statuses, “Beauty lies in the eye of a beholder”.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the fundamental question, “What is programming? (Coding, Computer programming)”. My answer would be pretty subjective this time – “It’s a way to solve material world problems with efficiency and optimization”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-programming-an-art-or-a-craft&#34;&gt;Is programming an art or a craft?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art can be faked, but the craft can’t. Well, this is true indeed. Any piece of art ever created is subjective, to make it more cheesy with modern day WhatsApp statuses, “Beauty lies in the eye of a beholder”. Art requires a sufficient amount of psychological operation to convenience the value. Some artists are clever, they create on top of their precursors, it’s a safe bet. Some do create something very appealing to the masses, where they can relate themselves with them. This happens because, most of the things that we see around were built upon a system by a small group of people who eventually convinced everyone what’s good for them. Art and historiography are no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that Steve Jobs once said, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Well, that’s true. A frugal structure as shiny as Venus is not worth of love. With all these perceptions and interpretations, I have come to believe that, programming is a craft rather than an art. It could be romanticized as art, but seldom have some truth to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;beauty-of-craft&#34;&gt;Beauty of craft&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the history, there wasn’t much emphasis given to craftsman / craftswomen compared to artists. Even it’s true today. Dignity of labor can only be achieved if we pay attention to the work of craftspeople. Some Nordic countries have achieved this to some extent, but it’s an alien concept to many, or it has become hard for large economies to breakout off the complex system that they have created and try something different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who built Taj Mahal are unknown, the people who built Pyramids are unknown. So what have we got? Egos of historians, media, and politicians. Bygones are bygones, but I like it when Linus Torvalds says, “Talk is cheap and show me the code”. With my experience working with lathe machines and garage have always made me think about the precision and accuracy. Scientists do the same, crafts work, some are underrated and some are unsung heroes/heroines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s also a dichotomy in this craft of someone being better, but I think the competition is healthy as the outcome of competitive craft is a better solution rather than a better subjective perspective, which in my opinion have already been said and told long back, and it keeps on reiterating as an old wine in the new bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid growth of technology, it has become a bit easier for people from any part of the world to learn and build things by the means of programming. Today, every craftsmen/craftswomen is able to get their due credit, who could have their own creativity and own design. All thanks to open source and the culture that has been developed overtime. There are still some issues with psychological operations that go around reputation, but let&amp;rsquo;s hope it&amp;rsquo;ll be obsolete as we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true ingenuity is when we write our own code. It’s a craft which can give wings to our creativity, artistic biases and solving the problem at hand. The advent of AI would probably solve or make it easier for the concerns that our left part of the brain had. Hopefully we’ll get some time to solve the problems of our right part of the brain. Or will we merge them together?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Memories of childhood..things that were lost</title>

      <description>Where should I begin? Did I have the best childhood in the world? I don’t think so, but the fact that I didn’t know anything about childhood or adulthood was a solace.
“Knowing Nothing” could be a taboo in this generation. But knowing nothing and knowing that I don’t know anything is something that made me a care free child, and I loved it. But it didn’t last for a very long time, as I realized that I wanted to pass examinations to qualify for the next classes!</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Knowing Nothing” could be a taboo in this generation. But knowing nothing and knowing that I don’t know anything is something that made me a care free child, and I loved it. But it didn’t last for a very long time, as I realized that I wanted to pass examinations to qualify for the next classes! Life is all about experiences, one cannot possibly control their experiences, especially when they are younger. Good, bad or ugly, you’ll only know when you grow up. Personally, for me, it was the combination of everything, and that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start from the warmth of the sun, the one that helps with the mornings, photosynthesis, and beautiful ‘sunsets’ sometimes. Getting back home after school, washing my body with cold water, and feeling a little chill and warming my legs on the balcony was fun. I barely remember someone telling me that exposing oneself to the sun is a good thing and that was my way of getting vitamin D. And I feel that it wasn’t that sunny at that time, even if the afternoons were a good time to play with friends. We barely got tired, never cared about the sweat, neither did my friends, we looked all fresh after we used to sprinkle water on our faces, and felt elated with what we all did in the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was in class two, I looked in a mirror, touched my face and had an existential question—“Who am I?” I had it a few times after that, especially in the morning when I went out to brush my teeth. Furthermore, I couldn’t find the answer and I moved on. Sometimes, I think even if I had tried a little more, my life would have been different now, I presume. Nothing’s absolute when everything is a variable in chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And fast-forward to the next three years, when I saw the wind, and the cloudy evenings. I used to feel thrilled about summer evenings, especially the beginnings of the monsoon rains. I used to sleep on the terrace and enjoy the wind and the raindrops. Surprisingly, I don’t remember much about rain at that time. Maybe it was destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the rain a few years after that. I used to stand alone and get soaked in the rain, and run around and enjoy nature’s showers. Not only that, but I never caught a cold at that point in time. I don’t know why. Perhaps that’s how nature loved me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, looking back on all these things, I feel that the sky is the only constant that I can relate to. I cannot find the same climate anywhere. I don’t know what spring, summer, rainy and winter seasons are anymore. It’s nice to hear the phrase “Change is the only constant in life”, but it comes with a cost, where you neither know what happened nor why it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Recently, I started playing computer games. Well, I know they are not new to many people here, but, me being a gamer? A cold day in hell. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can call myself a &amp;ldquo;gamer&amp;rdquo; now. Because my interests are in minimal games that range between 1-100 MB.
Prelude It was inevitable that I should have to switch to some starter GNU/Linux distributions. As there was a situation where I could not have suddenly switched to the Masterrace distros, I started to look into the distro&amp;rsquo;s software manager and then I found the category called &amp;ldquo;Games&amp;rdquo;.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started playing computer games. Well, I know they are not new to many people here, but, me being a gamer? A cold day in hell. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can call myself a &amp;ldquo;gamer&amp;rdquo; now. Because my interests are in minimal games that range between 1-100 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was inevitable that I should have to switch to some starter GNU/Linux distributions. As there was a situation where I could not have suddenly switched to the Masterrace distros, I started to look into the distro&amp;rsquo;s software manager and then I found the category called &amp;ldquo;Games&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends are great gamers, but not me. The reason being I was never raised in the cradle of computers or technology. Another reason is, I just find it wasteful when a lot of GPUs&#39; energy gets sucked in by high end games. But, here we are today. The open source community makes games where I can read the source code and they are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not my first time that I have gotten to the nine day wonder of gaming. I used to play some FPS games on my Linux machine, then I used to do the &amp;lsquo;silent quitting&amp;rsquo; without regrets. But this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different. I found this game called &lt;em&gt;Assult Cube&lt;/em&gt;, which is around 50 MB and it gives a decent full-fledged FPS experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;offshoot&#34;&gt;Offshoot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found many other games (or maybe I exhausted all of them during the research) which are minimal and keep me entertaining during the break. The irony is, a break is metaphorical. Some are really addictive. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mention every single one of them here, when you can find some really good ones that are your type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming is addictive. It feels like I&amp;rsquo;m going into a loop which I don&amp;rsquo;t realise when I&amp;rsquo;m in. It&amp;rsquo;s a focus inside distraction. Hypnotism has never been so real. Hope self-discretion doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn into indignation, as I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose my new found love!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some favorite movies</title>

      <description>I am a big movie buff. Since the day I started using the computer, before diving into the internals of the computer, I’ve spent a lot of time watching movies. Maybe that’s a fractal stain in almost all Indian Engineering colleges. Even now, I love to watch movies/TV shows like the rest.
Phase 1 I don’t exactly remember what was the first foreign film that I watched. Back then, I used to have a friend who gave me a lot of English movies, such as Inception (which I watched after five years), Fight Club (which I watched lethargically), Prestige (which I watched but didn’t remember).</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I am a big movie buff. Since the day I started using the computer, before diving into the internals of the computer, I’ve spent a lot of time watching movies. Maybe that’s a fractal stain in almost all Indian Engineering colleges. Even now, I love to watch movies/TV shows like the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;phase-1&#34;&gt;Phase 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t exactly remember what was the first foreign film that I watched. Back then, I used to have a friend who gave me a lot of English movies, such as Inception (which I watched after five years), Fight Club (which I watched lethargically), Prestige (which I watched but didn’t remember). I think I really got interested in cinema after watching this movie from the playlist called The Illusionist, it was a story of a magician played by Edward Norton (whom I recognized from Fight Club). I loved that movie so much back then. Not only that, but I think I watched it a couple of times and recommended to one of my other friends as well. If I remember correctly, I also watched a couple of Hindi movies that I really liked, such as Ek Villain. I’m mentioning this explicitly because watching movies on a computer without ads was a new experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;phase-2&#34;&gt;Phase 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got more mature, I started watching movies with a bit more fervor. This is the phase where I started exploring the genre of non-linear movies, the Christopher Nolan type movies. I researched a lot about this genre, they were called as &lt;em&gt;mind-bending&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;mind-boggling&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mind twisting&lt;/em&gt; movies. Never liked to use the term non-linear, as &lt;em&gt;mind twisting&lt;/em&gt; was exciting and had a primal first best impact. In this phase, I watched almost all the English language mind twisting movies that I could find through blogs. I’m going to write a separate blog on my favorite mind-bending movies in the future. I enjoyed a lot while watching these movies, as they required me to have focus and attention to details with the hope of understanding the movie completely or near to it at the first sitting. It gave me focus and helped me to look at things differently rather than boring conventional ways. Apart from my improved observational skills, my greatest achievement is that I was able to totally indoctrinate one of my friends to this genre. Even today, they ask me recommendations for the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;phase-3&#34;&gt;Phase 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all good things must come to an end, all mind twisting movies got exhausted. Later on I jumped the ship and started watching psychological thrillers which were slightly inclined towards nonlinear genre. Till day, I’m watching them. They never bore me at all. Now my horizons have expanded as I watch a lot of foreign language films (thanks to the Internet) and OTT platforms have made them easy to access for a huge audience and that’s great. This phase was more about the contemplation of the cinemas that I had watched, I used to watch and that I might watch in the future. It was a refreshing experience when I realized that I had gained a decent amount of knowledge, perspective, and worldview through cinemas. Probably, watching cinemas for knowledge happened during Phase 2, which really made me think critically and understand the world through someone else’s lens. I should also thank a cinema website called as &lt;a href=&#34;https://thecinemaholic.com/&#34;&gt;The Cinemaholic&lt;/a&gt;, whom I used to follow daily and found a great deal of awesome recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you must be curious that what phase am I currently on. Well, the answer is infinity. I’m not going to explain that to you, that’s my little secret. If you love me enough, maybe you’ll understand that one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are my favorite movies? Let me tell you the top three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976051/?ref_=tt_mv_close&#34;&gt;The Reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Undoubtedly, it is the best movie. It made me cry. The story of love, grit, and disallowance (I understand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/&#34;&gt;Kill Bill Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – It is celebrated as a revenge classic by many, but for me, it’s a story of internal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/watch?v=vXYB5DpqVSU&amp;amp;si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE&#34;&gt;The Count of Monte Cristo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Knowledge is power and destiny favors the brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still reading this and wondering where’s the Interstellar or Inception, probably you should wait for the future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hiding in plain sight has many dimensions. Sometimes, whatever you are looking for is before you, but you cannot see it; other times, it’s right before you but you don’t notice.
Steganography has been an art since the ancient days used to write hidden messages. It has evolved over the ages, and has changed form for the better. Nowadays we have software to hide and obfuscate messages. In this article, we’ll take a look at some amazing steganographic tools which are tiny yet powerful.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hiding in plain sight has many dimensions. Sometimes, whatever you
are looking for is before you, but you cannot see it; other times,
it’s right before you but you don’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steganography has been an art since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography#History&#34;&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; days used to write
hidden messages. It has evolved over the ages, and has changed form
for the better. Nowadays we have software to hide and obfuscate
messages. In this article, we’ll take a look at some amazing
steganographic tools which are tiny yet powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;steghide&#34;&gt;Steghide&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steghide is one of the most popular steganographic tools out there.
It comes preinstalled in some of the GNU/Linux distributions. If
it’s not installed, you can download it from your package manager or
you can check their &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/StefanoDeVuono/steghide&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. It can hide data inside images and audio
files, it supports JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a text file named secret.txt and try to hide it inside
an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;steghide embed -cf yoda.jpg -ef secret.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here -cf is cover file and -ef is embed file. The caveat is, you
should make sure your cover file is larger than your embed file,
that’s a no brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/2.png&#34; alt=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s delete the secret.txt and see if we can extract it back
from the cover file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;steghide extract -sf yoda.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/3.png&#34; alt=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the -sf is stego file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/4.png&#34; alt=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our secret.txt is extracted. Wanna see what’s inside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/5.png&#34; alt=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;strings&#34;&gt;Strings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s digress from the topic a bit. Strings is a command line tool
that helps to display printable strings in a file. In a sense, it’s
just like cat command. If you didn’t know already, now it’s a chance
to explore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/6.png&#34; alt=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;strings can be super helpful in steganographic challenges. For
instance, let’s say, a flag or password is embedded inside an image
file. And you have to match or put printable strings together in
order to solve the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cat out the file, you will end up with gibberish characters
printed out on to your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat yoda.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/7.png&#34; alt=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas, if you use strings, you’ll get a bunch of strings with
printable characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;strings yoda.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/8.png&#34; alt=&#34;8&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them, one of it might be your password or flag or a clue to
the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;exiftool&#34;&gt;Exiftool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exif is a good place to hide your secret message. Exiftool helps to
view the information about metadata of images or files. Besides,
embedding secret messages, exif data could provide some juicy
information about the image, such as, geo coordinates, camera model,
creation date and so on. You can use simple tools like gThumb or
GIMP to edit medtadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;exiftool yoda.jpg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/9.png&#34; alt=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;binwalk&#34;&gt;Binwalk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kali.org/tools/binwalk/&#34;&gt;Binwalk&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for searching binary images for embedded files and
executable code. It is actually a forensic tool, which helps to
analyse and audit binaries. It gives plenty of options to tinker
around binary files. Let’s see couple of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have source code of a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/10.png&#34; alt=&#34;10&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just displays the embedded data in a given file.
If you want to extract the data from a binary, use -e flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/11.png&#34; alt=&#34;11&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file is extracted to _OpenShot-v2.6.1-x86_64.AppImage.extracted
folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/12.png&#34; alt=&#34;12&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wavsteg&#34;&gt;Wavsteg&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WavSteg is a tool written in Python, which can hide data in files
with a wav format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;stegolsb wavsteg -h -i piano.wav -s secret.txt -o stego.wav -n 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/13.png&#34; alt=&#34;13&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/14.png&#34; alt=&#34;14&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While extracting data, you have to specify the exact size of
embedded file(secret.txt) in bytes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/osintforall/steganography/15.png&#34; alt=&#34;15&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;other-useful-resources&#34;&gt;Other Useful Resources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many online tools and professional software that could
facilitate steganography. Some of them are in the following.&lt;/p&gt;
