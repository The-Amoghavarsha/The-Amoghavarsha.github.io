      <description>&amp;ldquo;Community:Â a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a fission reaction! If we consider the whole world as a giant community and start dividing it into subgroups, there would be millions of little groups. Some call it diversity, and some call it poles. Whatever it is, we live in some kind of community, knowingly or unknowingly.
Some communities we choose deliberately because they pique our interest, and some of them are just inevitable.</description>
