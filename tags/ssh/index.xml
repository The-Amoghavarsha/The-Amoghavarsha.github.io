      <description>In the previous article you learnt how to connect between two Linux machines, in this tutorial, you are going to learn how to manage more than one ssh keypair effectively.&#xA;In your .ssh directory, create a file called config. Inside the config add the following lines:&#xA;Host Cat HostName cat.com User amoghavarsha IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa IdentitiesOnly yes Host Dog HostName dog.com User amoghavarsha IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.1 IdentitiesOnly yes Host * AddKeysToAgent yes IdentityFile ~/.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how you can do pair programming with your friends using some simple tools?&#xA;To achieve this, you only need two things: ssh and tmux.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve already explained about ssh in my other articles, you can go and check them out to get some basic understanding.&#xA;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed tmux, you can do so by typing the following command (Works for Debian based systems):&#xA;sudo apt install tmux On the remote server, start a new tmux session.</description>

In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to teach you the step-by-step process to communicate between two computers using SSH.&#xA;Basics The idea is pretty simple. There are two Linux computers; let&amp;rsquo;s call them A and B. To access computer A from B (connecting to A using B&amp;rsquo;s machine), we need to place B&amp;rsquo;s public key inside A.</description>
