<p>The true ingenuity is when we write our own code. It’s a craft which can give wings to our creativity, artistic biases and solving the problem at hand. The advent of AI would probably solve or make it easier for the concerns that our left part of the brain had. Hopefully we’ll get some time to solve the problems of our right part of the brain. Or will we merge them together?</p>
