            What about about? I really don’t know. Well, I’m the founder of Osint For All, I have a couple of YouTube channels that I started recently, I created this website, I watch movies/TV shows, I’m on social media, I follow some news, I do coding, I use GNU/Linux and rest you can click on other links and figure out.
But, seriously, what about having an about page? Initially I had removed my ABOUT page from this site and after some time I thought I would use this page to blog about MYSELF (subjective based on viewer’s perspective) sometimes.

            Where should I begin? Did I have the best childhood in the world? I don’t think so, but the fact that I didn’t know anything about childhood or adulthood was a solace.
“Knowing Nothing” could be a taboo in this generation. But knowing nothing and knowing that I don’t know anything is something that made me a care free child, and I loved it. But it didn’t last for a very long time, as I realized that I wanted to pass examinations to qualify for the next classes!

            Recently, I started playing computer games. Well, I know they are not new to many people here, but, me being a gamer? A cold day in hell. I don’t know if I can call myself a “gamer” now. Because my interests are in minimal games that range between 1-100 MB.
Prelude It was inevitable that I should have to switch to some starter GNU/Linux distributions. As there was a situation where I could not have suddenly switched to the Masterrace distros, I started to look into the distro’s software manager and then I found the category called “Games”.

            I am a big movie buff. Since the day I started using the computer, before diving into the internals of the computer, I’ve spent a lot of time watching movies. Maybe that’s a fractal stain in almost all Indian Engineering colleges. Even now, I love to watch movies/TV shows like the rest.
Phase 1 I don’t exactly remember what was the first foreign film that I watched. Back then, I used to have a friend who gave me a lot of English movies, such as Inception (which I watched after five years), Fight Club (which I watched lethargically), Prestige (which I watched but didn’t remember).
