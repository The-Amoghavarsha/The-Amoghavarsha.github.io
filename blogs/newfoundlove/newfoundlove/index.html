        <p>Recently, I started playing computer games. Well, I know they are not new to many people here, but, me being a gamer? A cold day in hell. I don&rsquo;t know if I can call myself a &ldquo;gamer&rdquo; now. Because my interests are in minimal games that range between 1-100 MB.</p>
<h1 id="prelude">Prelude<a href="#prelude" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>It was inevitable that I should have to switch to some starter GNU/Linux distributions. As there was a situation where I could not have suddenly switched to the Masterrace distros, I started to look into the distro&rsquo;s software manager and then I found the category called &ldquo;Games&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>My friends are great gamers, but not me. The reason being I was never raised in the cradle of computers or technology. Another reason is, I just find it wasteful when a lot of GPUs' energy gets sucked in by high end games. But, here we are today. The open source community makes games where I can read the source code and they are minimal.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not my first time that I have gotten to the nine day wonder of gaming. I used to play some FPS games on my Linux machine, then I used to do the &lsquo;silent quitting&rsquo; without regrets. But this time, it&rsquo;s different. I found this game called <em>Assult Cube</em>, which is around 50 MB and it gives a decent full-fledged FPS experience!</p>
<h1 id="offshoot">Offshoot<a href="#offshoot" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I also found many other games (or maybe I exhausted all of them during the research) which are minimal and keep me entertaining during the break. The irony is, a break is metaphorical. Some are really addictive. I don&rsquo;t want to mention every single one of them here, when you can find some really good ones that are your type.</p>
<h1 id="final-words">Final Words<a href="#final-words" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Gaming is addictive. It feels like I&rsquo;m going into a loop which I don&rsquo;t realise when I&rsquo;m in. It&rsquo;s a focus inside distraction. Hypnotism has never been so real. Hope self-discretion doesn&rsquo;t turn into indignation, as I can&rsquo;t afford to lose my new found love!</p>
